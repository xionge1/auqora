# Notes to Self

This document will be a notepad of my thoughts on what to do.

**Parousel**
- make parousel on home page (index.html) dynamically resize based on screen size of user

**Reading images in img file to a json file**
- purpose: dynamically add images so I don't need to manually edit the javascript document every time I add the image.
- potential ideas: use of JSON files to read into
