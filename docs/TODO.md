# Notes to Self

This document will be a notepad of my thoughts on what to do.

**Parousel**
- make parousel on home page (index.html) dynamically resize based on screen size of user
- on desktop: make parousel take half the length of screen and add some kind of text on right.
- paraosul but text that fades.
- add link to go to artworks page?


**'[COMPLETE]'Reading images in img file to a json file**
- purpose: dynamically add images so I don't need to manually edit the javascript document every time I add the image.
- potential ideas: use of JSON files to read into
- COMPLETED: wrote python script that gets run when site gets deployed. python scrip uses os library/module to create a list of the files in directory that i want the names of. Then i wrote to a txt file seperated by commas. Javascript then will read the file and dynmaically add images to page
